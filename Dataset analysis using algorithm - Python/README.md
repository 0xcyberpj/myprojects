### Daksh 2020 - Utsav - Predict the culprit

### Machine Learning
We are given with Train and Test CSV files and said to predict the villain value in the criminal_test.csv

We used the RandomForest, LogisticRegression and NaiveBayer Algorithms

Analysis: On checking accuracy of each algorithms

NaiveBayer --> 71% 
=> The accuracy was low and got around 2500 values of 1 for villain

LogisticRegression --> 92% 
=> Even through accuracy is High only around 260 values of 1 for villain. Since it was too low, Finally chose ** RandomForest Algorithm **

All the files related to coding of RandomForest and submission.csv is attached. 
Also for reference, We have attached the coding and predictions of LogisticRegression and NaiveBayer Algorithms
